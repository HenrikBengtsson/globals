Package: globals
================

Version: 0.6.0 [2015-12-12]
o findGlobals() is updated to handle the case where a local
  variable is overwriting a global one with the same name,
  e.g. { a <- b; b <- 1 }.  Now 'b' is correctly identified
  as a global object.  Previously it would have been missed.
  For backward compatibility, the previous behavior can be
  obtained using argument method="conservative".


Version: 0.5.0 [2015-10-13]
o globalsOf() now returns attribute 'where' specifying where
  each global object is located.
o BUG FIX: cleanup() now only drops objects that are *located*
  in one of the "base" packages; previously it would also drop
  copies of such objects, e.g. FUN <- base::sample.


Version: 0.4.1 [2015-10-05]
o BUG FIX: globalsOf() failed to return global variables
  with value NULL.  They were identified but silently dropped.


Version: 0.4.0 [2015-09-12]
o findGlobals() and globalsOf() gained argument 'dotdotdot'.
o Explicit namespace imports also from 'utils' package.


Version: 0.3.1 [2015-06-10]
o More test coverage.


Version: 0.3.0 [2015-06-08]
o Renamed getGlobals() to globalsOf().


Version: 0.2.3 [2015-06-08]
o Added [() for Globals.
o findGlobals() and getGlobals() gained argument 'substitute'.
o Added cleanup(..., method="internals").


Version: 0.2.2 [2015-05-20]
o Added Globals class with methods cleanup() and packagesOf().
  Added as.Globals() to coerce lists to Globals objects.


Version: 0.2.1 [2015-05-20]
o getGlobals() gained argument 'mustExist' for controlling whether
  to give an error when the corresponding object for an identified
  global cannot be found or to silently drop the missing global.
o findGlobals() and getGlobals() gained argument 'method' for
  controlling whether a "conservative" or a "liberal" algorithm
  for identifying true globals should be used.


Version: 0.2.0 [2015-05-19]
o Moved globals function from an in-house package to this package.


Version: 0.1.0 [2015-02-07]
o Created.
