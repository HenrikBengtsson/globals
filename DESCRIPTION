Description: Identifies global ("unknown" or "free") objects in R expressions
    by code inspection using various strategies (ordered, liberal, or
    conservative).  The objective of this package is to make it as simple as
    possible to identify global objects for the purpose of exporting them in
    parallel, distributed compute environments.
