and returns a tweaked expression.}

otherwise not.}

identified global cannot be located.  Otherwise, the global
is not returned.}

\description{
Get all global objects of an expression
}
\details{
There currently two methods for identifying global objects.

The \code{"conservative"} search method tries to keep the number
of false positive to a minimum, i.e. the identified objects are
most likely true global objects.  At the same time, there is
a risk that some true globals are not identified (see example).
This search method returns the exact same result as the
\code{\link[codetools]{findGlobals}()} function of the
\pkg{codetools} package.

The \code{"liberal"} search method tries to keep the
true-positive ratio as high as possible, i.e. the true globals
are most likely among the identified ones.  At the same, there is
a risk that some false positives are also identified.

\examples{
b <- 2
expr <- substitute({ a <- b; b <- 1 })

## Will _not_ identify 'b' (because it's also a local)
globalsC <- globalsOf(expr, method="conservative")
print(globalsC)

## Will identify 'b'
globalsL <- globalsOf(expr, method="liberal")
print(globalsL)
}
\seealso{
Internally, the \pkg{\link{codetools}} package is utilized for
code inspections.
